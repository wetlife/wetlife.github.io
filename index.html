        <p>Buddhism has the right idea about releasing the concept of self. Humans are mostly comprised of bacteria. These bacteria are what produce many of the nutrients needed by human cells.</p>
        <p>Take cyanocobalamin, vitamin B12, as an example of a nutrient preovided by a human's microbiome. Animals don't make B12. Plants don't make B12. Cells require B12 to metabolize proteins and carbohydrates into energy.</p>
        <p>Whole foods freed whole holobionts. Define whole food as a food with nothing bad added and nothing good removed. A million people died of Beriberi in Asia when rice began being polished. It was discovered that this scourge is a symptom of a societal deficiency in vitamin B1. Fortification attempts to replace nutrients after "refinement" removes them.</p>
        <p>The holobiont is the collective including all symbionts in a system. When a person eats, he or she feeds more than a human: the microbiome gets fed, too.</p>
